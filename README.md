# Data-Visualizations-Using-R-and-Python
This repository contains the data visualizations code on various datasets and extracted the useful insights from those using R programming language.

Problem: The Aviation industry is undoubtedly the safest, fastest, and most comfortable mode of transportation. The reason being the Aviation industry has some great features like reliability and safety. However, Aviation accidents can still not be avoided even though there are many advancements in technology and weather forecasting techniques. News such as Air crashes, the disappearance of Flight due to human negligence, hijacking, bad weather conditions, fuel starvation, and mechanical failure of Flight is still heard these days.

Solution: We will look at various reasons for flight crashes and the fatality rate with a variety of assumptions between the years 1908 to 2019 which will be concluded from the plots during statistical analysis and data visualization.
